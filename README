This project contains the scripts to facilitate:
	- the setup of a simulation using SeisSol
	- postprocess the data
	- postprocess the frames created via a visualisation tool (e.g. VisIt, Avizo)
	- sanity checks

A description of the folders follows.

SeisSol_setup:
Contains a tool used to create a pickpoints list given the size of the domain and the number of pickpoints; this is then added to SeisSol's PARAMETERS.PAR file to set up the simulation.

Matlab:
The subfolder "checks" contains matlab scripts used to check for symmetry in the point strike slip scenario and the neu to metis converter.

Post-processing:
Contains the scripts required to convert from the pickpoint format into VTK (for VisIt) and AmiraMesh (for Avizo).

Vis_Tools:
Contains scripts to:
	- interlace frames for 3D rendering
	- cut a series of frames 13600x3072 into 1360x768 subframes for z2 (AESOP display)
Plus it also contains a sample attributes.xml file to be loaded in VisIt with symmetrical Gaussian distribution and two guides: one on how to use VB.3 (to synchronise the playback of the multiple movies on the AESOP) and ffmpeg.
