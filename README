This project contains the scripts to facilitate:
	- the setup of a simulation using SeisSol
	- postprocess the data
	- postprocess the frames created via a visualization tool (e.g. VisIt, Avizo)
	- sanity checks

A description of the folders follows.

SeisSol_setup:
Contains a tool used to create a pickpoints list given the size of the domain and the number of pickpoints; this is then added to SeisSol's PARAMETERS.PAR file to set up the simulation.

Matlab:
The subfolder "checks" contains matlab scripts used to check for simmetry in the point strike slip scenario and the neu to metis converter.

Post-processing:
Contains the scripts required to convert from the pickpoint format into VTK (for VisIt) and AmiraMesh (for Avizo).
