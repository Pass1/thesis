This project contains the scripts to facilitate:
	- the setup of a simulation using SeisSol
	- postprocess the data
	- postprocess the frames created via a visualization tool (e.g. VisIt, Avizo)
	- sanity checks

A description of the folders follows.

SeisSol_setup:
Contains a tool used to create a pickpoints list given the size of the domain and the number of pickpoints; this is then added to SeisSol's PARAMETERS.PAR file to set up the simulation.
